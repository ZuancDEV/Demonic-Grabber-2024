## Errors/Fixes

If you get the message: No module named 'Crypto' or 'Cryptodome'
> open a cmd and type `pip install pycryptodome==3.14.1`

> You probably have python 3.12 which has some new shit so downgrade to [python 3.11.9] for the script to work!
> If the script doesnt work, open the file 'create_target_file.exe' and run it (Antivirus and Windows Security must be closed).
